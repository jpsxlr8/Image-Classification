# Image-Classification
Image classification is the process of categorizing and labelling groups of pixels or vectors in an image according to specific rules.<br>
Image Classification can also be done by using less complex models provided by Scikit-Learn,but by using TensorFlow we can build a neural network for the task of Image Classification.<br>
